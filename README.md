# xkb-us-fr-layout
XKB Keyboard layout I personally use. Variation of US QWERTY layout with french diacritics available through AltGr

## Installation
The `usfr` file belongs in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

## Usage
Use the command
```bash
$ setxkbmap usfr
```
to set the layout.

The change can be made persistent by editing `.xprofile` or `.xinitrc`.
